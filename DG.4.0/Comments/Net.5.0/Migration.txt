====================
The best migration steps way for me:
====================
1. Analyse old projects with portability-analyzer ('Analyze Project Portability' option of project context menu).
2. Optimize old projects
3. Make blank Net.5.0 project
4. Copy code from old project to new one
5. Check reflection GetField calls (Net.5.0 has '_' as prefix for many fields)
6. Check properties of resources: build action -> Resources, don't copy to output directory

Location of DLLs: I:\Program Files\dotnet\shared
